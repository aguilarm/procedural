# Procedural

This is a collection of small experiments with procedural generation in JS.

To start, I'm loosely following [this video from javidx9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZY9YE7rZJw) which
creates an elite-style galaxy map procedurally in C++.

## Running

Run `npm install` to get your node modules, and then `npm start` to serve up a build of this at `localhost:1234`.
I've used Parcel to compile the Typescript here with (as of writing) zero config. Pretty nice.
